@marcorubio why is the gop not calling out jim jordan as they did al franken?  double standard?  where do you stand on his ignoring sexual abuse?
@congressmanhice @housegop why is jim jordan not being held accountable by the gop for  his ignoring sexual abuse...al franken was forced out because of a picture...jim ignored actual abuse of young men!  is it a different standard in the gop if it happens to men?
@seanhannity why is jim jordan getting a free pass in ignoring sexual abuse?  al franken got no such pass because of a picture?  double standard from fox and the gop?  or is  abuse of young men not a gop issue?
@davidcorndc @realdonaldtrump today would be a good day for jim jordan to be held accountable for ignoring sexual abuse ... al franken did not get a free pass for his act... why the double standard?
@jim_jordan @repadamschiff will you testify as to why you let sexual abuse occur under your watch?
@therickwilson why is no one calling out jim jordan for ignoring physical sexual abuse?  al franken was forced out but with jim it’s just ignored!
@jim_jordan bet if anyone  of them were told of sexual abuse of young men and boys under their watch ...they would actually do something about it!  unlike you who allowed it to happen!

thread: the southern baptist convention is acting against sexual abuse. this is not a new crisis; the actual crisis has been occuring for decades. sexual abuse is the ugly underbelly of many organizations. here are four stages of the sbc crisis and some thoughts:
"the #sbc's renewed moral intensity clarifies these spiritual/moral violations. no longer just bad behavior, now this behavior is identified as sexual abuse, harassment, &amp; misconduct. now we call them sexual crimes rather than look-the-other-way activities. this is growth."
this is a godly reaction by first baptist clarksville &amp; even more indication the culture around sexual abuse in the sbc is changing. https://t.co/lidl3c5klc
"there is not necessarily more sexual abuse occurring right now. but more survivors are speaking out because of this spiritual/cultural shift. the #sbc, with help from the media, opened the door and survivors are bursting through it. hopefully, predators are running the other way."
"strong continued sbc leadership will lower the risk of sexual abuse, along with increased healing and revival as trust returns to the church. trust, healing, and revival are key, as fewer people are harmed. predators and enablers must be removed from ministry. this is imperative."
"@hbobrow1hbobrow @marvswife it's been known as a fact jim jordan allowed the abuse of young boys in his charge to continue year after year! with ample proof that many boys being abused was begging him for help but jordan did nothing, nothing at all! he assisted the sexual abuse to continue, year after year!"

"@joromo3417 @allanichan @jww372 @numbersmuncher @jaycaruso tenth maybe. there are always sealed indictments. not all of them have to be related to q. some could be mundane, run of the mill indictments. to act like there haven't been numerous arrests related to child/human trafficking and child pornography/sexual abuse is disingenuous"

homosexuality is a matter of choice while rape and sexual abuse deprives people of their right to say no but they're more disgusted by a same sex relationship than an adult having sexual relations with a child and it's sickening.

"@eyesonq i can't look into their hearts but true pedophilia is a sexual orientation! there are people (usually men, i would imagine) who fall in love and are sexually attracted to children. i am not sure if any are born this way but sexual abuse imprinting sexual desire--we know this."

@howardfineman @gop @jim_jordan @realdonaldtrump the fact he is accused of covering up sexual abuse should be mentioned every night on the news when he appears on it.
"@washtimes @dcexaminer @dailycaller @latimes-it's amazing how little the fake &amp; corrupt mainstream media covers the multiple instances of rape &amp; sexual abuse at nbc, the cover up of epstein’s elite pedophiles by cbs &amp; abc, &amp; instead decides to attack fox news as a diversion."
"@seanamulcahy @anniemc41333265 @leaningleft46 @djandyhealey nope. we label males as paedophiles, and males exploit the entirely daft queer theory to worm their hideous way through every safeguarding barrier known to god and man. it's exactly the same for sexual abuse, assault and rape of women and coercion"
@marklevinshow i could care less who pays for whose lawsuit. for 3 yrs @abc covered up the sexual abuse of children to shield high profile people. this should be enough for every american to stand up to the msm and say enough! jail time for every @abc exec who knew and stayed silent.
@swargnier @jeanhatchet yet another reason. it's almost like the same demographic that made the satute of limitations on sexual abuse is benefiting off it <u+0001f914> what a convenient legal excuse to avoid accountability and consequences for horrendous crimes.
"@kaeleyt low priority? there's recognition that it's sad and terrible but that's it. because there are many other problems that are more important and deserve money and attention over women's sexual abuse justice. <u+0001f937> consistent with dismissing rape allegations, bad rape laws, etc."
@naveedajamali how is this guy even in public office! he's running around attacking and trying to disrupt people fighting for the integrity of our democracy while he has a history of standing by virtually colluding with sexual abuse
@adamsbomb @adimiro @andrew_pepsi @joncoopertweets except for the fact that this victim actually has an eye witness to the sexual abuse who was employed by epstein and she also signed an affidavit under oath. epstein was a convicted pedophile who was allowed to use mar-a-lago as a hunting ground.
"@adamsbomb @adimiro @andrew_pepsi @joncoopertweets by the way, assholes who constantly side with the perpetrator, call the victim a liar and question why they didn't want to come forward sooner is exactly why victims don't come forward. i strongly encourage you to go volunteer at an organization that assists sexual abuse victims."

@jim_jordan @repadamschiff so you're going to ignore trump's crimes just like you ignored your doctor friend's sexual abuse crimes. you really are showing god and the world what kind of man you really are.

@jim_jordan @repadamschiff will you ever be accountable for your involvement in the sexual abuse scandal?
@jim_jordan you should have to testify under oath about why you did nothing about sexual abuse under your watch as an assistant coach at osu!! https://t.co/onmckjoqym
