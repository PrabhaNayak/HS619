@RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump How do you feel about Jim Jordan and his having ignored sexual abuse of his players...now how would you feel if it were a Democrat?  Thought so....
@marcorubio Why is the GOP not calling out Jim Jordan as they did Al Franken?  Double standard?  Where do YOU stand on his ignoring sexual abuse?
@CongressmanHice @HouseGOP Why is Jim Jordan not being held accountable by the GOP for  his ignoring sexual abuse...Al Franken was forced out because of a picture...Jim ignored actual abuse of young men!  Is it a different standard in the GOP if it happens to men?
@seanhannity Why is Jim Jordan getting a free pass in ignoring sexual abuse?  Al Franken got no such pass because of a picture?  Double standard from FOX and the GOP?  Or Is  abuse of young men not a GOP issue?
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump Today would be a good day for Jim Jordan to be held accountable for ignoring sexual abuse ... Al Franken did not get a free pass for his act... why the double standard?
@Jim_Jordan @RepAdamSchiff Will you testify as to why you let sexual abuse occur under your watch?
@TheRickWilson Why is no one calling out jim Jordan for ignoring physical sexual abuse?  Al Franken was forced out but with Jim it’s just ignored!
@Jim_Jordan Bet if anyone  of them were told of sexual abuse of young men and boys under their watch ...they would actually do something about it!  Unlike you who allowed it to happen!

"The California Catholic Conference declined comment, though executive director Andrew Rivas called child sexual abuse by priests “a legacy of shame.”   https://t.co/ot4xB84i0N"

"Gov. Gavin Newsom approved the new law last month. It not only gives victims of childhood sexual abuse until age 40 to file lawsuits, but also gives sex abuse survivors of any age three years to file — until Jan 1, 2023. https://t.co/ot4xB84i0N"
"Now, just as the “Me, too” movement brought more sex abuse crimes to the fore &amp; more abusers to justice, hopefully the new law changes in CA and elsewhere will help give survivors of sexual abuse an added boost of courage to tell their stories and seek justice in the courts."
"1,000 sex abuse lawsuits, most against Catholic church, were filed when CA lifted S.O.L.'s for 1 yr in '03, according to an attorney who represents an Olympic medalist &amp; other survivors of USA Gymnastics sexual abuse, along w/victims of former USC gynecologist George Tyndall."

Many victims of sexual abuse do not realize the extent of their abuse or even acknowledge their experience until many decades after the abuse occurred.  https://t.co/ot4xB84i0N
"In other words, this window would allow any claims of childhood sexual abuse, regardless of their current SOL, to be filed within three years from the effective date of the statute.    https://t.co/ot4xB84i0N"
"Earlier in October 2019, Gov. Newsom also approved Assembly Bill 1510. That bill gives victims who allege sexual abuse by former USC campus gynecologist George Tyndall an extra year to file lawsuits.   https://t.co/ot4xB84i0N"
Survivors of childhood sexual abuse in California no longer need to suffer in silence. They can finally have their voices heard.   https://t.co/ot4xB84i0N

That women disproportionately suffer more sexual abuse than men is not up for debate. For sure, men often don't talk about their experiences as much, which might mean things for stats, but stats speak."

Thread: The Southern Baptist Convention is acting against sexual abuse. This is not a new crisis; the actual crisis has been occuring for decades. Sexual abuse is the ugly underbelly of many organizations. Here are four stages of the SBC crisis and some thoughts:
"The #SBC's renewed moral intensity clarifies these spiritual/moral violations. No longer just bad behavior, now this behavior is identified as sexual abuse, harassment, &amp; misconduct. Now we call them sexual crimes rather than look-the-other-way activities. This is growth."
This is a godly reaction by First Baptist Clarksville &amp; even more indication the culture around sexual abuse in the SBC is changing. https://t.co/Lidl3C5KlC
"There is not necessarily more sexual abuse occurring right now. But more survivors are speaking out because of this spiritual/cultural shift. The #SBC, with help from the media, opened the door and survivors are bursting through it. Hopefully, predators are running the other way."
"Strong continued SBC leadership will lower the risk of sexual abuse, along with increased healing and revival as trust returns to the church. Trust, healing, and revival are key, as fewer people are harmed. Predators AND enablers must be removed from ministry. This is imperative."

No secret there.
All of Congress knows.

WHAT were these Repubs thinking?"
"If Jim Jordan is someone who  can turn a blind eye to the wrongest of wrongs (sexual abuse by a Doctor), why not turn a blind eye to real corruption and defend Trump."
"Why is Jim Jordan still in Congress? He turned a blind eye to sexual abuse when he was a wrestling coach, and has lied about it though a number of people who were there at the time say he knew, ignored it, and is now lying about his complicity. The coach he enabled abused 170+."
@Talking_Monkeys @Reuters It’s also gross and enraging that it barely made the news when it came out the other day how Hillary tried to help Harvey Weinstein by trying to get the story about his rape and sexual abuse of women killed. She’s a monster and the media needs to stop protecting her.
@RealJack @realDonaldTrump Just had a great idea.  Since Republicans requested Hunter Biden and Democrats won't allow him as a witness.  Democrats can offer the Ohio State sexual abuse victims to testify on Jim Jordan's behalf.  How's that Jim?  Does that work for you?

@notCursedE That is substantially true.  It’s why no men should be in women’s and children’s safe spaces.  I will own it.  99% of sex crimes are committed by men and 90% of sexual abuse cases in toilets / changing rooms occur in mixed sex ones.  I am happy to be excluded from these spaces.

It seems unlikely that this is a *deliberate* part of the monitoring and cultural coercion program. But sexual abuse is an entirely predictable side effect of giving men this level of state-backed control over a household.
@dtbyler Both the CCP and PLA are *heavily* patriarchal and do very little to control sexual abuse *even outside of the colonial context.*

"Allegedly Jim Jordan acknowledged then turned a blind eye to sexual abuse of boys under his watch. If true, he should be held accountable. There is no telling how many boys were harmed while he failed to report the abuse, and who have feared speaking out. He needs to answer."
"@YegRiverEdm All of the above &amp; embezzling from his own charity, bribery of government officials, extortion, sexual abuse, crimes against humanity, &amp; childish bullying for self-aggrandizement.Stealing, emoluments abuse, general disregard of the Constitution &amp; he probably ran a red light."

If @Jim_Jordan defended his students as much as he defends @realDonaldTrump this wouldn't be an issue. Sexual abuse, and those reporting it, shouldn't be shrugged off. But he would rather defend the Criminal in Chief than a bunch of students. https://t.co/hAFOPxPNMp"

"@HanSolo25563981 @Franklin_Graham @OhioStAthletics @Jim_Jordan Right. It's not a trial. Jordan has not been able to ask questions of his accusers while they were under oath. Jordan was not aware of sexual abuse. THE ABUSER IS GUILTY, NOT EVERYONE ELSE IN THE BUILDING! No testimony of abuser under oath. For abuse, ask the POPE!"
@GOPChairwoman I hear a staffer the the GOP office was told that Jim Jordan admitted he knew of the sexual abuse at his school. Since they told a staffer then you also knew. You are just as guilty.

@GirlzGotGuns @WeAreFairCop As a victim of a serious sexual assault I've raised this with police and CPS. Of course it happens just like male rape happens. What I take issue with is the anti trans stance that if a trans woman is raped (vaginal penetration) that it is dealt with as male rape.

"@BoSnerdley Reed at least deserves to have new evidence &amp; expert witnesses go before a judge. For sexual assault crimes, he has never had a trial which should be done, victims deserve to see their cases tried. Sex offenders don't get death penalty. Did Reed murder Stites or did the fiance?"

"@aura625 @Miss_Anathema @AdamBaldwin That's sensible. It's a stretch, though, to imagine that 23 people have lied over a 30-year period. Add the tapes where Trump actually boasts of sexual assault and the 2005 Howard Stern interview... in a trial, you'd most likely vote to convict."
"@aura625 @Miss_Anathema @AdamBaldwin Yes &amp; no. I genuinely respect that middle sentence. But, again, the words are Trump's own words. We've got him on tape boasting of sexual assault. He walked in on undressed teenage girls for 5 years. Question that? He boasted of that as well. This is more than enough to convict."
"@aura625 @Miss_Anathema @AdamBaldwin I agree with you in the sense that I dislike prosecutions with limited physical evidence. But the type of reaction that you're exhibiting is precisely why women often don't report sexual assault.
They're not afraid of the rapist. They're afraid of you."
"@aura625 @Miss_Anathema @AdamBaldwin Actually, 23 accusers isn't ""hearsay"" in a legal sense. Not if the victims themselves come forward.
In a rape trial, Donald Trump's repeated boasts of sexual assault would most likely be admissible.
Bottom line: If you were on the jury and his name wasn't Trump, you'd convict."
"@aura625 @Miss_Anathema @AdamBaldwin Excuse me, but the victims *have* come forward, except for the teenage girl who has the strongest case among the children. Some of them talked about the rapes years ago, long before 2016. And Trump has boasted of sexual assault - repeatedly. This is an actual physical rapist."

Some black families need to shift the culture. Why can’t we talk about trauma? Why can’t we y’all about sex? Why can’t we talk about sexuality? Why can’t we talk about sexual assault within the family? Why cant we talk about depression or mental illness? It’s a damn shame!
